    <h1>Call for Work</h1></br>
  <h2>This will be the fifth issue of a running project started in 2017. So far, each issue has had some overarching theme and exists primarily as a publication chimera. That being said, with this new issue, the first in this year and decade, we would like to expand the possibilities of the project to be more of a digital space or venue than simple publication. 

This issue's theme will deal with creativity politics, creatively approaching politics, and the effects politics and context have on creativity. Consider your current state, hot takes you might have (they don't need to be realistic, reasonable, or logical), and brain juice. How do these flow? Do you have thoughts on conspiracy? What role should creativity be playing? Do you have other questions entirely? Go for it. 

While we have no rules, if you'd like to see what our project has looked like before, all four previous issues are available just on that table there.</h2>
